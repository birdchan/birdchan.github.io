# MPAA admits mistake, 15 not 44

I found it hard to believe that MPAA made this kind of big error. After all, many bills in the House are based on these findings. However, I do appreciate their honesty. It is not easy to admit this kind of embarrassing mistake. I am not sure if it is a coincident but that, DRM starts to get dropped as well.
