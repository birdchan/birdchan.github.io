# Polaris Project

![](http://www.polarisproject.org/logo-polaris.gif)Katherine Chon and Derek Ellerman started the Polaris Project in 2002 at Brown University. From a casual conversation on US history to slavery happening nowadays. Modern slavery is not a well-known issue to the general public, but it's a very large problem to the whole human population. It's in fact a global issue. Most of the victims have no means to get out of their situations. I am so glad to see that Katherine and Derek are running the Polaris Project to speak for those who are voiceless.
