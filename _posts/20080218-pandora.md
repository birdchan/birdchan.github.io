# Pandora

I sometimes need to play music at my work place to keep myself from falling asleep. I have subscribed to napster ($9.99 per month) for quite a while until I found this free online radio player. It's call [Pandora](http://pandora.com/). If you are like me, listening to the same genre of songs, then you will like this. Basically, you start with typing in an artist's name, or a song's name, Pandora will search for a closest match. From this closest song, then comes the next related song, then the next related song, and so forth. The best yet, there is no advertisement! Try it out!
