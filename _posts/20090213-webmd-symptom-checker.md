# Symptom Checker

This [Symptom Checker tool](http://symptoms.webmd.com/symptomchecker) is quite amazing! I am sure there have been times you have felt some pain or discomfort at certain part of your body, but it was not severe enough for you to drop everything to see a doctor. Well, this tool can do the pre-screening for you. I don't think this tool can replace your doctor but it can at least give you an idea based on your symptoms. Try it out!
