# Napster $5 per month

![](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/10/napster-logo_sm.jpg)Most of you know already that Napster rolled out this $5 per month plan a week ago. I have been pretty skeptical about it for a while until I have done some research on it today. So far I believe this is the best deal you can find today... unless you do p2p. Yeah, unlimited streaming of particular songs, this surely beats pandora or the like. $5 to download 5 mp3 songs? That's the market price. I don't see any ripoff here. I then proceeded to sign up and found out that I have been a member with them since my college days... haha, those were the good old days. I had trouble using the online music player, but after installing the windows executable it worked perfectly fine. Man, music keeps me awake at home and at work, much better than coffee! Give it a try!
