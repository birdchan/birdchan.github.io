# How to be persuasive?

![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516pA-TpG1L._SL500_AA246_PIkin2,BottomRight,-18,34_AA280_SH20_OU01_.jpg)I came across this [post](http://www.moskalyuk.com/blog/yes-50-scientifically-proven-ways-to-be-persuasive) which talks about this book called **Yes! 50 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be Persuasive**. Even though the context is business-oriented, it's still good to know and apply these persuasive skills in life. If you want to know a little more details of one of these points, check out the post I mentioned before.
