# Pulling from Git

Perhaps Git is still new, I couldn't find any one-click solutions to simply pulling a copy from a git repository in osx. If you are new to git, and you are a osx user, and you just want to pull the latest code from a repository, you are at the right place. I will show you the quickest way to do just that.
