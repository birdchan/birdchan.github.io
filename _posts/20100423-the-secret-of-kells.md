# The Secret of Kells

![](/images/the_secret_of_kells_cd_cover.jpg)I wasn't really expecting much at the beginning of this movie. After all, I am more used to the japanese animes kind of drawing. Ten minutes into the movie, I almost wanted to turn it off, but was too lazy to do so in my chair. After a while I found myself fascinated by the artistic drawing of it. Lucky me this movie turned out to be quite good. Kinda reminds me of Caroline. Ooops... I meant, [Coraline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline_%28film%29). ;)
