# Saying no to UML

![](/images/uml_perspective1_annot.gif)I have been reading some articles on UML and how nice it is to draw the initial picture of the whole system design. There are claims that say there are some tools out there that automate code generation to create empty classes and methods based on the UML diagram. What a novel idea! So I went and hurt for "those tools".
