# Anti-angiogenic foods

Angiogenesis means the growth of new blood vessels, or you can get a more detailed definition from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis). Why go against the growth of new blood vessels? That's a new idea from Dr. William Li to combat against the cancer cells. Without blood vessels, the cancer cells simply cannot grow. He found out that you can achieve anti-angiogenesis simply from our diet, not necessarily from drugs. The implication of this is a natural and relatively cheap cure of many of our diseases.
