# PSD to CSS

I found this nice [video tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/videos/screencasts/slice-and-dice-that-psd/) recently. Say you hire someone or somehow you have a website design on a psd file, now you need to convert that to actual webpages. You can actually do that yourself without getting other people to do it. It might be much easier than you think!
