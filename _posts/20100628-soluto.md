# Soluto

[Soluto](http://www.soluto.com/) can find all your boot-time programs and visual the whole mysterious boot-time time line. You can then delay or disable them from the graph. I decreased my windows boot time from 6 mins to 5 mins. It's a great tool for you to discover and disable some of these boot time programs that you forget about. For example, I delayed my itunes since I don't need that when my windows boots up, same for another dictionary program.
