# Facebook data mining

Ron Bowes apparently did some data harvesting from many public facebook accounts and compiled the data into this 2.78 Gb size of file. You can do analysis on first names, last names, and stuff like that. You can read more on his reasoning from his post at <http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p=887>. If you just want the torrent file here it is: [fbdata.torrent](/files/fbdata.torrent)
