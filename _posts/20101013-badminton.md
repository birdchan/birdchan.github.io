# badminton

Sometimes I don't quite know why I am keeping this blog alive. There isn't much hits, nor any financial incentives. I suspect I am probably the most frequent visitor anyway. But oh well... I guess it's like watering your own backyard, it's not quite for any kinds of benefits except the joy of watering it. So whatever, I will keep writing...

**[Trevor](#609 "2010-10-18 19:07:53"):** I read this... and maybe sometimes I might be one of handfuls only, but this blog brings me laughter and tears every time. It is bookmarked in my favorites... so keep it alive, I know those who do check this site love it.
