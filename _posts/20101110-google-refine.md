# Google Refine

Ever worked with messy data? Whenever I get xls or csv files, I won't be so naive to think that the data is clean. Very often there are trailing spaces or even worse newline characters at the end of certain cells, not to mention typos and stuff. I have to physically go through all data cells to do clean up before getting them into the database.
