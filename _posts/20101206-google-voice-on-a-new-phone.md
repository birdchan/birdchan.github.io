# google voice on a new phone

I live in California, using at&t. In my case, recently I got a new iphone 4 to replace my old iphone 3g. The transition has been smooth even though I lost all settings from my individual apps. But, the one thing that caught my attention is google voice. Now, I am not blaming any party here, since it's always technically challenging to have two companies involved in one device.
