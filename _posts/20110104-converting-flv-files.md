# converting flv files

I was trying to upload a flv file to my smugmug area but failed. Even though the [smugmug wiki page](http://wiki.smugmug.net/display/SmugMug/Video+Formats) says it allows flv files, all upload methods failed on me. The html5 uploader will give a warning and stops, the java uploader will not allow you to pick any flv files, while the ole faithful uploader will allow you to upload any files but I was stuck at the "image processing" icon forever.
