# finding a song online

Say you just listened to a song on the radio, say it's lady gaga' bad romance. Now you want it badly. You probably will just search for it on youtube and the like. But say the government took out all of the lady gaga's music video links on youtube. What do you do? Surely there are other ways, but you probably won't spend that much time googling around.
