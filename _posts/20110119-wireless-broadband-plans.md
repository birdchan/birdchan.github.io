# Wireless broadband plans

I was doing some searches to find out all the available wireless broadband plans around the bay area. I have tried using it in HK and it seemed to be a good idea for people on the go. Basically, the idea is to have a 3g/4g usb stick to become the internet connection entry, that way you can have internet access anywhere. Below is the pricing info I have found as of Jan 19th, 2011. These are all monthly plans.
