**[Brian](#1435 "2011-03-04 17:35:32"):** agree. many of my friends are not even close to the 10-no but they are still struggling financially, it's hard to imagine how the 10-no people are living in hk...

**[carmanchan](#1434 "2011-03-04 06:34:58"):** i hink that (10 no) people are poor than the Middle.their Expenditure is more than their Income.when they were old,they don't have a Peace home.i think they are most Miserable people in the Social.
