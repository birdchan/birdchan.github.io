# osx random freezes

I have had my macbook pro 13-inch for about 2 years now. It's been running very well until recently, it randomly freezes. The keyboard and mouse would not respond and I would be forced to do a hard restart. After a few incidences, I noticed that this often happens when I am watching a youtube video or any long videos on VLC. At first I thought it was some corrupt libraries in the kernel and so I re-installed osx, but the problem remains. Then I clicked around, trying to investigate... to my horror, it was actually that my cpu fan stopped spinning!
