# Sam Richards - A Radical Experiment in Empathy

This is a powerful presentation about stepping into someone else's shoes. The moment you do that, all of a sudden many things that seemed weird before start to make sense. Conflicts seem to be unavoidable yet each side has its own views justified. Beneath the civilized humanity surface lies the same old barbaric force, driving us to obtain a better life at the cost of many others that we conveniently overlook. In the name of goodness, evil practices are allowed.
