# mysql python installation error on osx

I installed MySQL-Python (version 1.2.3 at the time being) from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/> on my osx 10.6, python version 2.6.1. Just do the usual "python setup.py build" and "python setup.py install". However though, in the python cli, when I do "import MySQLdb", I got some error.
