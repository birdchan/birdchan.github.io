# Making a backup of a dead hard drive

When you realize one of your (external) hard drives are making funny squeaky or ticking noise, it's probably a good idea to start making backups. However if unfortunately you have ignored the engine light until one day you can no longer mount the drive, I hope this little guide can still save you. BTW, I use osx, so keep going if you are on the same page.

**[Brian](#2186 "2011-09-13 21:27:32"):** there is a space after "ls". ;)
