**[santhosh](#2257 "2011-10-01 11:24:40"):** Thanks

**[Woody](#29694 "2012-11-27 21:02:19"):** Will a stopped wells fargo check appear to the recipient as (1) insufficient funds (2) stopped check (3) something more vague?

**[JP](#65748 "2013-10-01 06:13:46"):** The fee is now $31. The WORST part, though, is that the check is only cancelled for SIX MONTHS!!! What a rip off!
