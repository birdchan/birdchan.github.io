# Splitting and joining files

![](/images/winrar_icon.png)So I bzipped a 40G file last night. I checked the timestamp and it took about an hour to finish with my 8-core cpu. Since the 40G file is a text file, the resulting file is only 1.4G large. Impressive, I went on to get my morning coffee, happy.
