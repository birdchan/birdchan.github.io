# Trello

If you have a small organization and you need to share ideas and manage various tasks in the team, it would be quite a headache. Coz you are dealing with a mini growing social network, hopefully with something better than emails and phone calls. This is when you need trello (<https://trello.com/>). Take a look at their video and see if you can benefit from it. You could even use that to organize a small get-away to deal with the shopping list and packing items. Best of all, it's FREE. ;)
