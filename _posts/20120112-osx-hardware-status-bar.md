# osx hardware status bar

I really believe this little tool is essential for all you guys out there who care about what's going on with your hardware at any given moment. It's called [MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) from Raging Menace. Basically, you can see status of your cpu, memory, hard disk, and network traffic in real time on the menu bar. Slowness of any kind can now be troubleshooted with better supporting evidence. Try it out, it's FREE.
