# Patriot Black PBO Core Box Office

Recently I went on [newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822219002) and bought this "Patriot Black PBO Core Box Office All-in-one 1080p Full HD Media Player with HDMI PCMPBO25". (such a long name...) Simply put, a media box that streams to your TV with hdmi.

**[Patroit PBO user](#67074 "2013-10-23 01:05:42"):** It's actually sad to see you bought this. The company haven't developed any new update on the firmware and HIGHLY doubt that they would ever update this. They came out with the new Patriot box alpine, It came out with "ALPHA" software and updated to ALPHA software from their website after 4 months of so call development and later upgraded to version 3.0 with 1 primary thing added which was adding support for MKV files. From that alpha upgrade to 3.0. It took them 6 months to bring it out. I have bought my last Patriot product since then.
