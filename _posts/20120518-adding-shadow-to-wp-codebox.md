# Adding shadow to wp-codebox

Too bad [wp-codebox](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-codebox/) contains two divs namely wp_codebox_msgheader and wp_codebox, we cannot simply give the **box-shadow** to one single div. After playing with this a bit, here is my parameters. The css file is located at **/your-wp-root/wp-content/plugins/wp-codebox/css/codebox.css**.
