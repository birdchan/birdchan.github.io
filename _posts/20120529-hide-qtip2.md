# Hide qtip2

Sometimes when you click on a [qtip2](http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/) popup, you may want to close the popup somehow. For example, if your qtip2 popup contains a list of links, and clicking on the links will open up more popups. In that case, you would really want to close the previous qtip2 popup upon each link click. Well, here is how you can do that programmatically.
