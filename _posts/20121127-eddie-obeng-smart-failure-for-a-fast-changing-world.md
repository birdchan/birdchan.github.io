# Eddie Obeng: Smart failure for a fast-changing world



## Comments

**[Eddie Obeng](#55972 "2013-06-05 07:21:18"):** Hi. I just wanted to say thanks for featuring my TED Talk, and to tell you that I recently spoke at Google Zeitgeist Europe 2013 about ‘Generation Tomorrow’, and how it’s mindset, not age, that determines who will shape the future!
