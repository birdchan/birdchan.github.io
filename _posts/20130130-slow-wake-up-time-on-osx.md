# Slow wake up time on osx

My macbook pro has been slow on waking up. I noticed because it sometimes "hibernated" (borrowed from window). After a little googling I found out that the time-to-hibernate time on my system was only 70 mins. So if I close my lid for longer than 70 mins, the deep sleep will occur.
