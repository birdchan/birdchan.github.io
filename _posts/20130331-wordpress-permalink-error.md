# Wordpress Permalink error?

So after moving files and db data from an old ubuntu 10 server to my new ubuntu 12 server, I started testing my websites. As expected, certain things stopped working. I quickly installed the missing packages using apt-get, all looking good except my wordpress permalink feature was still not working.
