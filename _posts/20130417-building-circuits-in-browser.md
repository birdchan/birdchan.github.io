# Building circuits in browser?

My only hardware design experience was back when I was in college using [MAX+PLUS](http://www.altera.com/download/legacy/maxplus2/mp2-index.html). It was confusing to me at best. Gone are those days. Today I came across [circuits.io](http://www.circuits.io/). Basically, you can make your circuit design in your browser! I can imagine one day circuit design can even become open source.
