# AngularJS tutorial

![](/images/AngularJS-small.png)Here is a very nice step-by-step intro tutorial for AngularJS, from the [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) official site. You will see how the angularjs code is added to the sample project and for what purpose. I highly recommend this tutorial for anyone wanting to try out AngularJS.
