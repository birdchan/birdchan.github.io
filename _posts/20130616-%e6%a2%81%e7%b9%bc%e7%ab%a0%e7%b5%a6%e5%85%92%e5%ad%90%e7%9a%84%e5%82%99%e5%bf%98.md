# 梁繼章給兒子的備忘

**[Brian](#61469 "2013-08-09 00:17:03"):** that's a good idea! I guess I will have no choice but to buy a professional video camcorder then! ;)

**[Trevor](#61461 "2013-08-08 23:10:53"):** Remind me to make a video like this for Audrey and Elliot before I turn 40... wait, I have a better idea, remind me to make a video every 5 years of my life... this way, when they grow up, they could see the wisdom that dad had gained at that age and they could get to know me from it and see my age progress.... I'll remind you to make one too.

**[Trevor](#88208 "2014-02-24 01:24:25"):** Okay, it's time for us to make a video. It's been half a year, if we haven't done a video, then we have forgotten. I remember... that is why I came back to this video site to remind us. Please remind me when we meet up next time. Did you buy a good professional video camcorder? :)

**[Brian](#88264 "2014-02-24 08:39:53"):** haha, sure, I will look for one! =)
