# Wordpress not showing the themes

I was playing with wordpress 3.6 the latest version, but it didn't recognized any of the themes I installed in the **themes** folder. I did so much searches and finally gave up. Then installed 3.3 one of the older versions, works perfectly fine... If you are in the same boat, download an older version, it may just save your day.
