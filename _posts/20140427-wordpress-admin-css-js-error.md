# Wordpress admin css js error

My wordpress admin page was looking weird for a while. I opened up the debug console and found out some of the css and js files didn't load correctly. After doing some searches, I found the following fix from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18769141/wordpress-admin-not-loading-css-js).
