I was looking around for proper ways to place google's admob responsive ads onto my wordpress blog site. I found a few plugins here and there but wasn't too sure. Then I found the google official plugin:

[https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-publisher/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-publisher/)

This link should be ranked higher IMO. It will link to your adsense account and help you create and place ads based on your preference. Highly recommended!
