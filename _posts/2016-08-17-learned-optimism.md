Reginald Braithwaite [talked](https://github.com/raganwald/presentations/blob/master/optimism.md) about a book called "Learned Optimism," by Dr. Martin Seligman. Sounds interesting.

When we explain something that happened to us, it’s usually in terms of
* Personal vs. Impersonal
* Specific vs. General
* Temporary vs. Permanent

Pessimists tend to explain bad things as being personal, general, and permanent, while explain away the good things as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

```
I am always bad at doing just about everything.
That project for team A is just a one-time win.
```

Optimists tend to explain in the opposite ways: explain good things as being personal, general, and permanent, while explain away the bad things as being impersonal, specific, and temporary.

```
I am always good at solving puzzles.
That bug for project A will be fixed in a day or two.
```

Reginald concluded: Changing your explanations through repetition and consistency, changes your life: You become happier and more productive.
