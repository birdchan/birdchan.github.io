# Program shortcuts

![](http://www.keyxl.com/key/images/keyxl.gif)If you need to stay in front of your computer for work and possibly after work everyday, sooner or later you will get tired of using your mouse. Throughout the years, with my limited knowledge of some of the common shortcut keys I have saved so much of my time and arm movements. I think everyone of my generation should know most of the frequently used shortcut keys already. But if you are interested to learn even more shortcut keys for specific programs such as PhotoShop, Excel, etc, you will find this site <http://www.keyxl.com/> very useful. Certainly it's not possible to say goodbye to my mouse, but as much as possible I would rather keep my hands on my keyboard for the most of the time.
