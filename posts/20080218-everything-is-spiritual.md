# Everything is Spiritual

![](http://everythingisspiritual.com/eis/images/homelogo.gif)This is incredible! "[Everything is Spiritual](http://www.everythingisspiritual.com/)" is a DVD that looks at the creation account from Genesis one in the Bible, with all the latest science understandings we currently have. From the biggest like the galaxies, stars, to the smallest like the atoms, quarks, and sub-atomic substances. The speaker, Rob Bell, is the founding pastor of Mars Hill Bible Church. He is by far the most scientifically knowledgeable pastor I have ever known. The DVD is $20, and believe me, it is well worth the money. The talk length is 1 hr and 20 mins, I became more awake as I was watching it. It's definitely eye-opening to say the least!
