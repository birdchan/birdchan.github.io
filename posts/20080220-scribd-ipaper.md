# Scribd iPaper

![](http://www.scribd.com/images/platform/logo2.gif)This thing is amazing! You know how when you go to youTube the flash thing embeds the video file right? [Scribd iPaper](http://www.scribd.com/platform/home) basically embeds any word, excel, powerpoint, or pdf document on a flash player. Image you can view a pdf document online without waiting for your acrobat app to load, or view a word doc without downloading and opening with MS word. What's even cooler is that, you can sign up and use this tool on your own website, much like any other web APIs. Check out their demo video!
