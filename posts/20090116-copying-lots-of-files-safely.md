# Copying lots of files safely

Yesterday I had a chance to consolidate all my old small external hard drives data to one single external hard drive. But as many of you may have encountered, the file copying process often dies in the middle due to an error. Now you are left in the air, not knowing where to resume the process. Or if you are optimistic enough to try again only to see the same error again.

**[uut3](#1100 "2011-01-06 08:38:58"):** have u try the new version of teracopy?

**[Doug](#2157 "2011-09-08 07:06:10"):** One to test out (It is payware with a free evaluation version), is File Pilot Software’s FilePilot Copy. Example copy: 1.2 GB of 600 plus files in various sizes should normally be around 35 seconds. An update (compare source to target and copy only what is new in same scenario), will be a fraction of a second. Also has a super easy to use GUI and detailed log file. WILL NOT CRASH. Free evaluation software with no sign up available on the site: http://www.filepilotsoftware.com.
