# Lunascape 5 Genesis Beta released Feb. 10, 2009

Wow, this new browser [Lunascape](http://www.lunascape.tv/) can render webpages with the three most popular web browser engines. Trident + Gecko + WebKit. For those of us wanting to test webpage layouts thus installing IE7, firefox, and Safari, now you only need one browser. It's still in its beta version for now, but it looks quite good to me. In terms of [features](http://www.lunascape.tv/features/Default.aspx) it pretty much has everything you can think of. And it scores 100 on the Acid3 test. It's quite impressive.
