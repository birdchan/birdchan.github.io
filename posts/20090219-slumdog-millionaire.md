# Slumdog Millionaire

A few days ago one of my friends asked me to go watch ["Slumdog Millionaire"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048/). I saw some of the movie reviews saying it was a hype and all that, but I was like, ok, whatever, and went ahead to watch it. It turned out to be quite impressive to say the least. I was caught off-guard by the real life stuff in the movie. I don't want to give away the storyline here. If you are like me, sick of all the usual princess-romance or explosion-violence movies, this is the one movie you got to watch!
