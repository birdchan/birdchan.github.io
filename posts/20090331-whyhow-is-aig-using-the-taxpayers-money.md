# Why/How is AIG using the taxpayers

I found this [lecture video](http://vimeo.com/3841214) explaining quite well why and how AIG is using the taxpayers' money for this whole financial mess. Before watching this, you should watch this past post [Crisis of Credit Visualized](http://www.birdchan.com/home/?p=241) first to understand the bigger picture.
