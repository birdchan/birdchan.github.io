# Are we in control of our decisions?

Do you believe that you often make the best decisions? I think deep down inside we believe that, or at least we have no reasons to believe otherwise. Dan Ariely challenges this belief and argues that we are often misled to think that we are the one who makes the best choice. It's not all talk because he has many examples to show us. Don't miss out on this one. This is a 17 min video from [TED](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions.html).
