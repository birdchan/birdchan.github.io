# Google I/O

![](http://code.google.com/apis/wave/images/wavelogo.png)Oh my gosh! For all you programmers out there, you got to check out the [google I/O videos](http://code.google.com/events/io/) where they introduced new apps and stuff. At least, you got to see the [Google Wave video](http://code.google.com/apis/wave/). I think that will revolutionize the way we email, blog, and do online communication and collaboration in general.
