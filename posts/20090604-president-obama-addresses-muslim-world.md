# President Obama Addresses Muslim World

This is a major step Obama took to bridge the gap between US and the Muslim world. I really enjoyed listening to this hour long speech, which addresses where America stands in light of many things happening inside and outside of America. Below the video is the transcript from [WPO](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060401117.html):

**[Kelly Brown](#20 "2009-06-12 13:55:32"):** I really like your post. Does it copyright protected?

**[Brian](#21 "2009-06-15 13:04:05"):** I cited my source from WPO. If this becomes an issue later on I will take this post down. Meanwhile I hope people can take notice in our global political issues.

**[Schedule](#648 "2010-10-30 02:53:43"):** Maybe you should change the page subject title President Obama Addresses Muslim World to something more better for your content you make. I liked the post however.
