# Google Apps is out of beta

![](http://www.gadgetrepublic.com/fs/img/news/627x/gmail-logo2.jpg)Finally, gmail, gcal, gdocs, all those are out of beta, yeah~~~ What's the big deal? Ah... I don't know... ^^; Technologically google has always served me well, and so this seems to be more of a marketing move than anything.
