# Windows 7 activation already cracked

![](http://palisade.plynt.com/images/cracking-wep.png)I guess this is nothing new. Once again, the crack comes out before the release. Since the release will come out in 2 weeks, it doesn't seem to be enough time for ms to make the patch. oh man... bad q2 earning, merging search with yahoo, now a compromised new os. What's going on?
