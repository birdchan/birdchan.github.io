# NOOMA

![](http://g.christianbook.com/g/cms/0/633900/180_180Nooma.JPG)I just finished watching all of the [NOOMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nooma) videos from 1 to 20. NOOMA is a series of short films produced by Flannel promoting spiritual perspectives on individual life experiences. The storyteller [Rob Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Bell) is the founding pastor of [Mars Hill Bible Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Hill_Bible_Church). Each video is about 10 to 15 minutes.
