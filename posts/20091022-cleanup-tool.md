# CleanUp Tool

![](http://www.depressedfan.com/images/sweep0812.gif)My windows laptop has been getting slower and slower... to the point I cannot turn a blind eye to it anymore. Today I happened to try out this tool called [CleanUp](http://www.stevengould.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=69). It deleted **3.4** Gb temporary files on my laptop!!! I didn't know I was carrying junk with me all these times!
