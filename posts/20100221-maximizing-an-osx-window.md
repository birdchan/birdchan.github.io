# Maximizing an OSX window

This is often a frustrating experience to many new osx users, especially those who have used windows for many years. Often times I am ok with what the green zoom button does, coz it actually does make the current window bigger but just not maximized... Like most people, I settled with moving the window to the top left corner, then dragging the bottom right corner...
