# clock

![](/images/clock.png)I always have a clock at my office so I can easily see the time. Not sure about you guys, but I don't like to squeeze my eyes to read from my windows taskbar. Everything is good until some time last week the battery ran out. The "second" hand failed to go against the gravity struggling to go up at the "9" position. Poor me I have been consistently forgetting to bring in a new battery, I guess getting into the office on time already consumes everything I get in the morning. ^^;
