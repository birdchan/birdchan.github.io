# Bank ABA number lookup

![](/images/pictureofcheck.jpg)Sometimes you will need to find out a bank's [ABA number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number), say for a [wire transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer). Or the other way around, you want to double-check to see if a given ABA number is really the right number for a particular bank.
