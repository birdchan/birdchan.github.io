# CSS playground

At last! These guys did it! If you like [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and you are playing with it, you will probably want to check out these two online mini CSS IDEs. They are [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) and [CSS Desk](http://cssdesk.com/). I will be placing these two at my [tools page](http://birdchan.com/home/tools/).
