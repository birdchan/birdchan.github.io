# live video app

Just saw some videos and read some articles about this cool app called [Knocking](http://knockinglive.com/). Basically, it's a video live sharing app, somewhat like a webcam but on your iphone or android. Awesome, right? It's a free app, so check it out! Let me know if you get this app as well so we can try it out together. I have a feeling this kind of live video sharing apps will become mainstream soon.
