# College Inc

Just watched a very interesting [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/) video called College Inc. Basically many colleges are struggling financially and investors are coming in to help make them profitable. However, being a for-profit college somewhat turns you into a commercial institution that has the obligations to make profits. Imagine if you were the financially struggling school official making a choice between raising school fund somehow or turning to investors (quick cash but with strings attached), how would you make that decision? Was it a simple financial decision? Or was it a little more than that?
