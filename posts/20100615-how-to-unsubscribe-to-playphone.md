# How to unsubscribe to PlayPhone?

![](/images/playphone_1.jpg)If you are reading this post, chances are you already know what PlayPhone is. I first got to know PlayPhone when I was casually checking my AT&T bills on the AT&T website, then to my horror I found out I have been paying $14.99 a month for this PlayPhone service I never signed up for!!! If you have received random texts from 778-88 then just to know that you are paying $14.99 every month for that...

**[Kristen](#413 "2010-09-03 06:11:28"):** This is great if it would work. I did all of the above and am still getting charged and playphone says I am not subscribed.

**[Brian](#416 "2010-09-04 23:11:40"):** Hi Kristen, to my surprise I found out that my PlayPhone subscription got renewed automatically. I called AT&T's customer service and told them that I feel cheated by AT&T's billing system because I never signed up for PlayPhone's service, and that I put in extra effort to cancel their service but I still got put back to square one. The guy on the phone was very apologetic, and it sounded like he knew what I was talking about. He helped me cancel the PlayPhone service again, and he told me that I would get refunds from the months that PlayPhone charged me since the day I canceled the service.

**[Shannon](#2461 "2011-11-07 20:20:27"):** This same thing is happening to me...but with T-mobile. Every months I get a bill that says I'm being charged $9.99 a month extra for playphone...I've never even heard of that! So now its getting me really angry when I have to keep calling my phone company and complaining to have it removed, but apparently it keeps coming back. What's the deal? And how do I fix this...

**[Sam](#64798 "2013-09-18 17:10:25"):** PlayPhone scam ..... I never signed up for this. Have had a block on my account since June 11,2013. Att customer service said "he didn't know how this got through". Any ATTORNEYS looking for a class action suit? .... it's a sure winner. Research shows they now have 4 million members! do the math!

**[Blanche](#62291 "2013-08-17 09:21:25"):** I just discovered that I too was being billed $9.99 monthly for PayPhone. According to my ATT phone rep, ATT does "get a cut of the charge." However, it is truly PayPhone initiative -- they make it all too easy to sign up without realizing it. A SOLUTION: Ask your ATT cellular plan rep to sign you up -- free of charge -- for the PURCHASE BLOCKER, which will block ATT from being allowed to automatically charge your account for any apps. This will NOT affect your ability to purchase apps from iTunes or the App Store. I also asked the ATT rep to credit all back charges for PayPhone, which he did.

**[Blanche](#62292 "2013-08-17 09:23:46"):** By the way, the customer service number for ATT cellular is 800-331-0500.

**[Blanche](#62293 "2013-08-17 09:29:25"):** BTW, I meant to write PlayPhone in my posts above ... it was definitely a PlayPhone charge. Getting a cup of coffee now LOL...

**[Lindsay](#59592 "2013-07-18 06:50:15"):** I had this problem this morning. I went directly to AT&T. They removed the charge from my account and said my conversation would be noted in case of these problems in the future.

**[Grace M.](#53346 "2013-05-08 10:58:45"):** Hi Brian,

**[Brian](#53379 "2013-05-08 13:25:38"):** Hi Grace,

**[Michele](#72662 "2013-12-02 17:26:34"):** As Barry says, this scam is still going on. This really is not right.

**[Barry E](#72511 "2013-12-02 07:02:59"):** Scam still going strong as of 12-1-13. I started getting these charges a few months ago and thought I had cancelled and BLOCKED this using AT&T's site, but it keeps charging. I just got off the phone with AT&T and they sounded unaware of this scam. But the rep said she did cancel it, and refunded me last month's charge. I also called PlayPhone using the # above and unsubscribed via their archaic phone message service. So we'll see.

**[Hannah](#76921 "2013-12-16 14:11:52"):** I just got another notification. I have cancelled it 4 times. This is really making me angry.

**[KiaraB](#66865 "2013-10-19 14:39:01"):** I, too had an issue like this a few moments ago. My husband and I have 2 lines and we each received this text a few minutes ago for the 2nd time. After calling AT&T they somehow only found it on my line, refunded it and added the PURCHASE BLOCKER. This, supposedly is how to get the issue corrected. I also asked if they could send me a letter confirming it has been removed, refunded and corrected, however, they could only send a text. My suggestion to all, there is a class action that suit being pursued. If this has happened to you -Take Action!!

**[Fil](#57772 "2013-06-23 22:34:08"):** From the reports I read so far, it seems that AT&T is well aware of this scam and should be proactive in blocking it from its devices otherwise people will presume that AT&T profits from this scheme. I am also a victim of this scam. Yesterday, June 22, I suddenly found out that I've been charged $9.98 supposedly for subscribing to a PlayPhonePlayCredits (PlayPhone 2) when God knows that I don't play any game online, be it on my computer or my Galaxy phone. That scam company stated that it will renew my unauthorized subscription monthly. I already sent notification to AT&T about it but so far there has been no response. This Grace M. should be ashamed working in a company that steals money from unsuspecting people.

**[Grrrrr](#65321 "2013-09-25 14:21:24"):** What a scam. I just received a text today alerting me to a PlayPhone subscription renewal. Turns out it was the second charge of $9.98! I definitely never signed up for this "service". I cancelled the service on the website preventing next month's charge, added the Purchase Blocker free service, and got a credit for the charges on my next bill...which I'll watch like a hawk.

**[Cynthia B](#68851 "2013-11-12 18:14:58"):** This just happened to my husband and I with play phone subscription renewal. This has been going on since March and we never signed up for this. How can att allow this fraudulent behavior to continue with Playphone. Someone gets your phone number and automatically signs you up without your permission and bills your cell phone bill.....There has to be a class action lawsuit against this.

**[Cynthia B](#68853 "2013-11-12 18:16:49"):** playphone and grace...this is a scam...and i mean scam......cb

**[Cate](#261783 "2015-02-23 12:52:59"):** Sprint put the block on my account but that didn't stop Playphone from charging me a second time. Didn't realize I had to "unsubscribe" to something I never subscribed to! Thanks Sprint!

**[Brooke](#239815 "2014-12-12 12:11:53"):** I am getting the same thing with Sprint. My charge is only 9.99, but still, I don't want and didn't subscribe to it! It's not the phone company's fault. It's Playphone! I've never even heard of it, and now I'm getting charged. Sprint refunded my money for the previous months, so we'll see what happens. I've unsubscribed...or so I think I have!

**[Darren](#231665 "2014-11-25 17:35:22"):** This scam is STILL happening as of 11/25/14. Small $9.99 charges started appearing on my mobile bill about three months ago and I didn't really take notice. I'm usually more on top of these kinds of things but not this time. I just caught up with it today when reviewing my statement on Sprint's website. I immediately called their Customer Service Department (888) 211-4727 and in about 15 minutes they were able to cancel the PlayPhone "service", credit me back only 2 months worth (~$20.00) and also put a 3rd Party Block on my number. This is the first time I've ever had any kind of issue like this and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that a company would be so unscrupulous.

**[Travis](#312711 "2015-12-27 21:31:34"):** Merry Christmas, seems these people are still at it. Been dinging me $9.99 monthly since October. I've found out about this tonight when I went to pay my bill and wondered why it was more than it should be.

**[Crystal](#302669 "2015-09-21 18:43:35"):** PLEASE HELP ME!!!

**[Shelli](#305515 "2015-10-09 15:27:11"):** Still going on 10/9/15...I've been charged for 2 months even though Sprint put a block on my phone!

**[A](#317591 "2016-03-06 17:29:26"):** okay, so i to have the same story, but mine has been going on for way to long and am with sprint, this is a SCAM and to l only get back a credit of two months worth is bull s***

**[Dana](#397809 "2016-10-26 06:08:51"):** So I guess they switched from ATT to Sprint. I've been charged on the month of August of 2016 $9.99 from the same party . I called Sprint where I requested to be unsubscribed and asked for a refund back. No charges for the month of September, and now in October it charged me again. I just talked to another Sprint representative. She says it shows I unsubscribed in August and subscribed back in October. I don't know how is it possible , but this time the representative unsubscribed me again and did other changes to the account. She said beginning today, if I like to subscribe to any type of games it won't go towards the Sprint account, but it will ask me for the entire personal and card information. This way I will know if I willingly subscribe to anything. Hope it works.

**[Jenn](#357987 "2016-05-04 14:40:30"):** I have just found this on my bill, was refunded 3 months and I think we should get a lawyer. Fraudulent 3rd party charges should be not only caught by our service providers but how/why should they get away with this. These scammers are making bank !
