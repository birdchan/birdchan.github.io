# Debate: Does the world need nuclear energy?

Finally there is an open debate on this nuclear energy hot topic. I honestly thought that I knew enough on this matter, but after watching this video I realized there is a lot to consider. Whichever side you are on, take a look at this debate and learn the strongest findings and arguments from both sides. BTW, many from the audience changed their starting positions after the talk. ;)
