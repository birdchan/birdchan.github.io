# MP3tunes

If you like to place your music on the cloud, here is one good provider: [Mp3tunes](http://www.mp3tunes.com/). You can upload your music files onto their cloud. Once that's done, you can then access your music from your pc, or iphone, etc. Apparently they made the service available on so many phones and electronics, that you can even play your music on your ps3! See the whole list at <http://www.mp3tunes.com/cb/screenshots/>. The free account gives you 2 Gb to play with. Sign up now at: [ http://mp3tunes.com/signup](http://mp3tunes.com/signup)!
