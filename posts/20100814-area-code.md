# area code

![](/images/areacode_org_logo.gif)I found this website called [AreaCode.org](http://areacode.org) that lets you find out which area code corresponds to which area. So if you get a phone call with the area code 650, just look up the code in the table and you will see that the area is Daly City, Mountain View, or Palo Alto. You can also click on the 650-link to see the map. It's a very handy website.
