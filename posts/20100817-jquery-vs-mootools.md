# jQuery vs MooTools

If you are looking into learning javascript frameworks, this will likely be a question you will ask eventually. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) or [MooTools](http://mootools.net/)? They are both very well known and well developed. By chance I came across this site <http://jqueryvsmootools.com/> and I was quite impressed. The author did a pretty comprehensive analysis of these two frameworks. Good stuff! Be warned though, it's quite a long read! ;)
