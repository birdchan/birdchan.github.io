# Badminton online tutorial

![](/images/badminton_serving.jpg)There are so many badminton online tutorials out there. Among many that I have read, this site called [the Badminton Bible](http://www.badmintonbible.com/articles/) is the most complete and detailed. It contains pictures, detailed descriptions of postures, and also explanations on many things it covers. It is definitely a good starting point to get all your fundamentals down!
