# Melinda French Gates: What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola

Melinda French Gates is Bill Gates' wife. This is my first time hearing from her, and my respect for their family grew much more. From this talk, I see that she learns from the best industry leader, and then asks the governments and nonprofits to apply the same principles to their current work of improving local living standards. She is not just inspirational, but also pragmatic, and that sets her apart from the politicians.
