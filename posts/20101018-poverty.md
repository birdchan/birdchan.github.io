# Poverty

What comes to your mind when we talk about people in poverty? I think most of us will have images of remote villages, people sitting on the ground, children running around without clothes or shoes, etc. It's a depressing picture. I believe we probably picked up these images from some charity fund-raising events or some donation mails. While all these being true, that's only one part of the big story that unfortunately makes the general public feel pitiful and sometimes bad, and as a result to give donation. However, the last thing the poor people want is your pity. They are strong, they are smart, they are capable, and what they lack is just a little bit of capital. As the old saying goes, don't give them a fish, teach them how to fish. After watching this video, you may have a different approach to helping the poor.
