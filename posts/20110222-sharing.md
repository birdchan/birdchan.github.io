# Sharing

I believe we all have learned the idea of sharing, probably ever since our childhood. Parents have obviously good reasons to teach their kids early on to share with their siblings. Kindergarten teachers in school also encourage the students to share with their classmates. In general, sharing is a good practice in life among friends and family members.
