# Wael Ghonim: Inside the Egyptian revolution

[Wael Ghonim](http://www.ted.com/speakers/wael_ghonim.html) is an Internet activist and computer engineer, Google’s Middle East and North Africa Marketing Manager. As "[ElShaheeed](http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/08/google-executive-wael-ghonim-admits-he-was-el-shaheeed.html)," he started up an influential Facebook page that galvanized voices of protest in Egypt. In early 2011, he was detained by the Egyptian government for 11 days -- when freed after international pressure, he revealed his identity, and became a leading fugure in the youth revolution that forced Hosni Mubarak from power.
