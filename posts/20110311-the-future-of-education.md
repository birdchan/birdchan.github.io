# The future of education

Think about wikipedia and video lessons. Now, the power of that is simple: students can study at their own pace at their own time, thus can actually have interactions with the teacher and their peers at school on perhaps more in-depth discussions. Also with the fun testing games and reward system, the students are more motivated to keep trying without embarrassment. All the learning stats and scores already in the system can be analyzed and plotted into meaningful graphs for the teachers or coaches, the teachers can then decide if they need to intervene and how. Take a look and I hope you will get inspired by it. There is definitely a lot we can do to improve the education system globally.
