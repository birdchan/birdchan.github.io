# phpMyAdmin navigation frame not resizable

If you have long database table names you may find it frustrating to use phpMyAdmin, having the end portion of many long tables names truncated. There is really no easy way to widen the navigation frame either... Your last option is to horizontally scroll right... Nooooooooooo....
