# Mighty Mouse

![](/images/mighty_mouse.jpg)My mighty mouse scroll ball was fine for a month, but until recently scrolling up won't work. At first I thought I was a software issue, but after updating everything and restarting osx, the issue remains. If that happens to you, don't trash your mouse yet. Do this.
