# Jeditable – Edit In Place Plugin For jQuery

I want to recommend this awesome plugin to you called [Jeditable](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable). Imagine you have a text field you want to let your users make changes to and then save it. Won't you need a text field and a save button? How nice if the user can click on some text and edit it from there. Um... it's hard to describe what that looks like, you will have to [try out the demo](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable/default.html) yourself!
