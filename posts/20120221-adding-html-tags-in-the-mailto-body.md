# Adding html tags in the mailto body?

After much research, at least at this point [there is no way to include html tags in the mailto body](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/247245/is-it-possible-to-add-an-html-link-in-the-body-of-a-mailto-link). If a particular email client plays nice then you are in luck, otherwise there is no standard, or cross email client way to include html tags in the mailto body.
