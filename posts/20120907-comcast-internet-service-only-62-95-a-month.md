# Comcast Internet service only $62.95 a month?

I have signed up for Comcast's bundle deal for TV and internet a few months ago. After a while I cancelled the TV service. I wasn't really paying much attention to my bills until today I checked, Comcast is charging me $62.95 for internet service only? Really? Why???
