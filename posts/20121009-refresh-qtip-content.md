# Refresh qtip content

[qtip2](http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/) is very handy to show/hide additional information on websites. The qtip content is by default cached to minimize unnecessary fetching. However though, sometimes it's desirable to fetch for new content every time the tooltip comes up. In that case, use the **once : false** attribute to force re-fetching of new content.
