# Bay to Breakers

Whenever I see my [Bay to Breaker](http://zazzlebaytobreakers.com/) Zazzle 27934 profile picture, I always wonder if there will be more Bay to Breaker races to come. The race is not that long, and the path is just awesome going through SF's financial district and the golden gate park. I have heard rumors saying there may not be enough sponsors to support the event, so I better not miss it this coming year! ;)
