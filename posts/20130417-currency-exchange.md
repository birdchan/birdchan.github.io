# Currency exchange

Recently I came across this currency exchange peer-to-peer service called [CurrencyFair](http://www.currencyfair.com/). I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but it looks quite promising. Basically, you get the best exchange rate by skipping the banks. They claim their commission rate is 0.15% only, much lower than anything you could possibly find.
