# Enable USB debugging

At first, my **Android Device Chooser** wasn't showing any of my connected android devices. I did some reinstalling and rebooting, but nothing changed. Then I did some google searches and I was told to enable the **USB debugging** mode by going to **Settings > Applications > Development**. I checked my Settings app but couldn't find that. I thought I was crazy so I checked a couple times but still couldn't find it. Later on I read that the **Developer options** is hidden for Android 4.2 and newer, mine is 4.3... @#%^%@#$@#$@.
