# Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: java.nio.BufferOverflowException

If you keep getting this error **Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: java.nio.BufferOverflowException**, then just add the **Support Library**. Right click on your project, then Android Tools -> Add Support Library... Then just follow the steps to install that.
