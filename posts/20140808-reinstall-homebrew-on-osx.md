**[guizm0](#178186 "2014-09-22 14:47:31"):** This was very helpful, though the last line of that post needs updating, see below..

**[Henrik](#179452 "2014-09-24 07:49:02"):** Howdy. Just a small note that the Homebrew installer seems to have moved:

**[Aki](#179295 "2014-09-24 02:41:58"):** This solution seems to be of limited usefulness, as it's also deleting all the packages that have been installed.

**[Roys](#215692 "2014-10-27 08:09:07"):** I upgraded to Yosemite and my brew starting giving me errors. The solution provided fixed my problem with a little twist.
