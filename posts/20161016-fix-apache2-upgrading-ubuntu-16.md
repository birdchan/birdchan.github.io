# Fix apache2 after upgrading to ubuntu 16

After upgrading to ubuntu 16, my wordpress was acting weird. I get errors like **apache2.service - LSB: Apache2 web server Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/apache2; bad; vendor preset: enabled) Drop-In: /lib/systemd/system/apache2.service.d └─apache2-systemd.conf Active: failed (Result: exit-code)**, and **Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.**
